                    <h2>Chatbot Development Service</h2>
                    <p>In our Chatbot development service, we were using artificial intelligence (AI) and natural
                        language processing (NLP) technologies. In this way, our chat robots can communicate with users
                        by giving natural answers as if they were people. Rabot Chatbot has developed users to meet many
                        of their needs, such as providing information by messaging on digital media, and dealing with
                        various topics. With the improvements and integrations to be made in Chatbot, it is possible to
                        order, make an appointment, make reservations, buy tickets, get information about your bank
                        accounts and more.

                        Nowadays, we see that the trend in people is correct rather than talking. The fact that
                        messaging applications are used so much is an indicator of this. In cases where people have to
                        make transactions or receive information over the phone, they can often experience unnecessary
                        waste of time and boring experience. This is one of the most important reasons why they prefer
                        messaging.

                    <h2>Platforms Served</h2>
                    <p>The fact that messaging can be done through many channels, platforms or social channels requires
                        all of them to be brought under control and all customer questions and requests are answered.
                        Our Rabot Chatbot responds to your customers and meets the needs of platforms such as WhatsApp,
                        Facebook Messenger, Webchat, Instagram, Twitter, Skype, WeChat, Telegram, Slack.
                        Rabot Chatbot uses Google Dialogflow Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. It offers a
                        natural and rich chat experience with Dialogflow. It supports Google's Natural Language
                        Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. Technology giants such as Google, Apple, Facebook,
                        Amazon, Microsoft are working on chatbot and artificial technology. In 2016, Google (AI) has
                        increased its artificial intelligence work, while Facebook has opened Messenger to chatbots, and
                        Chatbot has enabled chat robots to become popular today.

                <h2>Why Should You Use Chatbot?</h2>
                <p>When we think about why Chatbot should be used, we see that the benefits to companies and
                    customers are more than one. Chatbots can instantly bring us the information or product we are
                    looking for on a website while chatting, and can instantly perform transactions with live
                    support or a call center. Companies offer chatbots that provide information to their customers,
                    carry out various operations, and provide product benefits that can offer many different
                    benefits.
                    Chatbots can be used proactively or reactively. They work reactively only when they develop to
                    respond to their customers' communication requests. The customer does not make any communication
                    without asking questions. When they are developed proactively, they automatically communicate
                    with customers in line with the goals and scenarios previously determined. For example, when the
                    product that the customer wants to buy falls below a certain price, the party that communicates
                    with it may be chatbots.

                <h2>Benefits of Chatbots</h2>
                <h3>Fast communication and transactions:</h3>
                <p>With Chatbots, you can save your customers from keeping them on the phone, and browsing the menus on
                    the web. You can quickly make their transactions with the dialog they will establish with Chatbot.
                    With Chatbot, you can direct the right questions to your customers and ensure that they reach the
                    right product they need in a short time. While an airline or tourism company allows its customers to
                    choose the most suitable among thousands of options, they can make their reservation while chatting
                    with Chatbot.

                    <h3>Continuous, uninterrupted service:</h3>
                    <p>Chatbots are able to provide uninterrupted service 24/7, allowing their customers to get an
                        instant response at all times. It is not clear when customers' communication needs will arise.
                        Research shows that the most important requirement for a good experience in customer service is
                        to be able to serve customers as quickly as possible. At midnight on an e-commerce site, it can
                        be difficult to find a customer representative who will give your questions live support for
                        your urgent needs.

                    <h3>Decrease in company expenses, increase in productivity:</h3>
                    <p>Chatbots can answer customers on many messaging platforms, social media, websites and mobile
                        applications. This reduces the number of customer representatives that will be needed for live
                        support in companies. Companies can save money and reduce expenses by reducing their customer
                        representatives. In addition, even if the number of employees is low, the burden of the
                        employees will decrease with Chatbot and it will be ensured that the employees can provide more
                        efficient service since Chatbot can solve many problems on its own.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Increase in company revenues:</h3>
                    <p>Chatbots can also play an important role in increasing companies' incomes. Chatbots can analyze
                        the
                        communication with customers, recognize their customers, and provide a personalized service to
                        increase sales. It can accurately determine when customers need that product or service and
                        offer
                        the right time. Also, it helps to catch the customers who run away due to the fact that it does
                        not
                        get the answer 24/7.
                        With our Chatbot development service, we develop your Chatbot from start to finish. We then
                        continue
