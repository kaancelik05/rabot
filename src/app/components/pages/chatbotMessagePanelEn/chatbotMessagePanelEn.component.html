          <p>In cases where Rabot cannot respond, Rabot Messaging and management panel comes into play. If the company
            does not have live support staff, the customer can forward their requests by phone or email at the point
            where they can not get a response from Rabot. If the firm has customer representatives for live support, the
            customer correspondence with Chatbot falls to the management panel at the point where no response is
            received from the Bot. The eligible customer representative can receive live support requests from the
            customer. Customer representatives can see from which channel the correspondence came from.
            Upon request, it is also possible to direct the calls that Chatbot cannot answer to the relevant customer
            representatives. Representatives can direct their conversations with customers to another customer
            representative when they need it.
