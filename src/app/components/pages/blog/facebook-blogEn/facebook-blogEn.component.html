                        <h3>Facebook Messenger Chatbot</h3>

                        <p>One of the biggest reasons why so many companies develop mobile applications for their
                            businesses is that they see it as another version of their website. They didn't take the
                            time to investigate how being on a mobile device would change how their customers wanted to
                            interact with their company.</p>

                        <p>Some requests are not suitable for mobile devices. As a result, many applications are not
                            used. When considering a use case for Facebook Messenger, you need to make sure that you
                            think of it from the perspective of the customer or user, not from the perspective of the
                            company. Perhaps you need a way to increase their interest after your client first discovers
                            your website or content and comes back to learn more.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Why Use Facebook Messenger Chatbot?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Surely you have heard of artificial intelligence. And this is a kind of artificial
                            intelligence. The native language interface is common in most Chatbot, but Facebook made it
                            easy to create a smart Chatbot by offering the Messenger Platform and providing developer
                            tools like the Chatbot engine.
                        </p>

                        <h4>• Sharing Your Knowledge Base</h4>

                        <p>Speaking traditionally, a knowledge base is a section of your website that regulates all the
                            resources and information a customer will need to correctly learn and solve problems with
                            your product. And sometimes, these knowledge bases can be cumbersome or difficult to
                            investigate. Facebook Messenger Chatbot is a way to better educate customers who have
                            questions about your product.</p>

                        <h4>• Diversification of Service Lines</h4>

                        <p>If your customer service team has more incoming requests than they can meet, it may be
                            because they just picked them up on the phone. Live Chatbots can respond to more requests,
                            reduce phone call volume, and allow service and support representatives to answer more
                            questions at the same time.r</p>

                        <h4>• Sharing Questions in the Customer Service Team</h4>

                        <p>If your customer service employees need a better way to share their questions with each
                            other, the right Facebook Messenger Chatbot can help more employees help to solve problems
                            faster.</p>

                        <h4>• Retaining E-commerce Customers During Payment</h4>

                        <p>You suffer from "abandoned shopping carts" on your e-commerce website and you need a way to
                            retain customers who may have problems during the checkout process.
                        </p>

                        <h4>• Is your audience on Facebook?</h4>

                        <p>This question is often rejected very quickly by companies that see Facebook as a purely
                            social platform, not for businesses. Even if your audience is not currently using Facebook
                            for their business needs, you should start by determining whether the Facebook marketing
                            potential is there.</p>

                        <p>
                            If you have an audience that uses Facebook extensively in their personal lives, they will
                            adopt Messenger as a means of communication. How they use Messenger can go beyond using
                            Facebook. Today, the use of messaging apps has actually outdone those of social networks.
                            And as new use cases emerge, the behavior develops with them.
                        </p>

                        <h4>• Can you support questions from Messenger?</h4>

                        <p>If you cannot support it, do not open a channel of communication with your potential
                            customers and existing customers. Even with a Chatbot automation, you will need to take time
                            to do three important things:</p>

                        <ul class="features-list">
                            <li><i class='bx bx-check-double'></i> Promoting your Chatbot</li>
                            <li><i class='bx bx-check-double'></i> Identify questions that the chatbot cannot answer
                            </li>
                            <li><i class='bx bx-check-double'></i> To follow the overall customer experience you created
                                with Chatbot</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            If you want to manage the above three items in the best way and want a perfect Facebook
                            Messenger Chabot, you can contact Ranna immediately. You can combine Messenger Platform
                            features such as message templates, persistent menu, built-in NLP (Natural Language
                            Processing) and more to create intuitive and personalized experiences. Each plan contains an
                            architectural diagram, code snippets and a step-by-step implementation guide. There is a
                            benefit to set off early in this area. As a new and open platform, Facebook Messenger needs
                            thoughtful and strategic Ranna to grow and shape your business.
