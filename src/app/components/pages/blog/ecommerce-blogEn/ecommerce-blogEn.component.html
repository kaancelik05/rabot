                        <h3>Chatbots for E-commerce Website</h3>

                        <p>Should you integrate a Chatbot into your digital customer experience? A very frequently asked
                            question by our customers. Our clear answer is YES! For e-commerce companies, we've compiled
                            the main information you need to know if you're not familiar with live chats or Chatbots.
                        </p>

                        <p>Chatbots are virtual assistants programmed for specific tasks. Chatbots can effectively
                            answer an unlimited number of site users at the same time. They are automated, support 24/7,
                            and are cheaper than paying employees to track questions. Response time takes place
                            instantly in any time zone. They can chat for hours without human surveillance.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            But Chatbots are computer programs too. They are as good as the code that makes them. For
                            this reason, ordinary Chatbots may not always understand a misspelled word or answer a
                            missing question. The only information they will have is the preprogrammed data they will
                            not have the ability to think about. So if you want the right Chatbot for your e-commerce
                            website, you should choose the right agency.
                        </p>

                            Artificially guided Chatbots have the ability to understand the meaning of a sentence, not
                            just its keywords. They may be aware of misspelled words, synonyms and ontologies. They are
                            also multilingual. Isn't it so exciting!</p>

                            artificial intelligence to improve knowledge. Powered by advanced artificial intelligence
                            technologies such as NLP (Natural Language Processing) and NLU (Natural Language
                            Understanding), Chatbots can guide interactions, answer questions, present personalized
                            notifications, collect feedback, schedule appointments, and even 'train' to learn human
                            behavior.
                        </p>

                        <p>Bots are lighter than apps and easier to interact with (no download required). There is a
                            world of undiscovered possibilities that companies can take advantage of. Especially for
                            e-commerce, live chats with integrated artificial bots seem like a much better alternative
                            to developing expensive app features.</p>
