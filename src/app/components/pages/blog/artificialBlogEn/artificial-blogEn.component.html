                        <h3>Artificial Intelligent Chatbot</h3>

                        <p>Consider the last online chat with a customer service representative. Maybe you were
                            complaining about getting the wrong item in your order. On the other hand, it is possible
                            that the person trying to solve your problem is not a person at all. In fact, the speaker is
                            quite likely to be a Chatbot.</p>

                        <p>Artificial intelligence has made Chatbots more realistic than ever. Talking Chatbots take
                            pizza orders, book hotel rooms and schedule appointments. In short, these Chatbots can now
                            do the job in any industry.</p>

                        <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
                            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) clearly shows how businesses and organizations work and what
                                they can do to maximize the ability of Chatbots to improve service, save costs and
                                increase participation.</p>

                            <cite>Rabot</cite>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>Chatbots are of two main types: those based on fixed rules and machine learning. The first
                            responds only to specified commands and displays only a fixed level of smartness. Give these
                            types of bots a command that they don't understand, they don't know what to do. It cannot be
                            smarter with more interaction or information.</p>

                        <p>The second type of chatbot includes artificial intelligence, not only commands, but also the
                            ability to understand language and the ability to learn. This technology is smart Chatbots
                            that can discover new patterns and become smarter as they encounter more situations.</p>

                        <p>Thanks to machine learning algorithms, we have come to a point where it will be more
                            difficult to say whether we are talking to a human or a computer. The business community has
                            benefited from Chatbot, which is usually deployed in customer service functions but
                            increasingly in internal processes and to assist training.</p>

                        <p>The belief that artificial intelligence and Chatbots is the next big thing in the marketing
                            world is widespread. Many marketers also believe that AI Chatbots revolutionize their
                            business by providing better customer service, satisfying customers after sales and adding
                            “personality” to a company's brand. Artificial intelligence can help companies create more
                            personalized experiences for customers by customizing the responses and content based on the
                            user's questions and interests. Also, speech boots are inexpensive, can work 24/7 and never
                            lose their tempo.</p>

                        <p>Here's a quick tip: educating Chatbot with enough data at all times. This will help them make
                            meaningful conversations. It is the most important step to make speech more natural than
                            robot.</p>

                        <p>Artificial intelligence has more features to serve us. And chatbot is one of the aspects
                            below it. An artificial intelligence-free Chatbot is just a bot that answers an FAQ
                            (Frequently Asked Questions). In order to meet the expectations of today's buyers, it is
                            necessary to answer more than this and give answers powered by artificial intelligence.
                            Internally, AI-powered Chatbots can quickly digest, process and report business data as
                            needed. For customer-oriented functions, customers can provide brief answers to questions
                            that include product and service lines or technical support issues.
                        </p>

                        <p>In the future, Chatbots will likely take things even further and offer strategies and tactics
                            to tackle business problems. Perhaps based on the classification of their speeches and
                            sensitivity analysis, there may be customer service bots to deal with customer cases.
                            Businesses today are expressly satisfied with the idea of integrating Chatbots into their
                            business processes and are confident that this will lead to improvements in efficiency and
                            customer satisfaction.
