                        <h3>Chatbot at Universities</h3>

                        <p>Artificial intelligence-supported chatbots help universities by offering more effective and
                            efficient support for candidates and new students. The development of Artificial
                            Intelligence (AI) has proven advantageous for various sectors in recent years. AI is a
                            branch of computer science where the program is created in such a way that it can absorb
                            external data, learn from it, and use learning to achieve a specific task and goal.</p>

                        <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
                            <p>Nowadays, a Chatbot can be easily applied to almost any area we know, and the university
                                is a good example of where we can apply a chatbot to assist candidates during the
                                application process and recruitment.</p>

                            <cite>Rabot</cite>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>However, why do universities need Chatbot for the internal management process? Here are a few
                            reasons why the university should implement a Chatbot as a service to students:</p>

                        <ul class="features-list">
                            <li><i class='bx bx-check-double'></i> The rise of social media and messaging apps: Social
                                media and messaging app technology has changed the way we communicate for the past 15
                                years. In order for the university to help new students, the university needs to adapt
                                to existing technology, where young people tend to use social media and messaging apps
                                to interact with each other.
                            </li>
                            <li><i class='bx bx-check-double'></i> Lack of updated information: Finding information
                                about admission to the university can be tiring and time consuming for candidates.
                                Sometimes, the information is not even informed on the university website, which makes
                                the admissions process even more difficult (and even worse, prevents applicants from
                                submitting applications).</li>
                            <li><i class='bx bx-check-double'></i> Real-time exchange on the university website is not
                                effective: Although the university website is the main source of login information, it
                                is unrealistic to change information according to the needs of students (and
                                candidates). Using official social media is a more reasonable way to update information,
                                or better yet, to use Chatbot.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Using Chatbot, the fast service, the difficulty of waiting for the real person to provide
                            online service can be significantly reduced. In many cases, after the applicants have
                            started sending the first question via live chat, one should wait a minute before they
                            actually reach them. Chatbot will respond to applicants in real time, no matter how busy
                            your office is.</p>

                        <p>It will increase the satisfaction of applicants and new students with personalized messaging.
                            Bots can personalize every message sent. Each applicant has different needs and features. A
                            well-developed Chatbot can respond to each thread with personalized content. This
                            personalized content will increase applicants' satisfaction and secure more student
                            enrollments.</p>

                        <p>It is important for universities to reduce labor costs. When the university decides to set up
                            a live support department, there is a lot to be prepared. One of the most important things
                            in the live support department is that the university needs to hire people to support these
                            applicants and new students online. Chatbots significantly reduce their hiring costs after
                            they are deployed to handle all incoming questions and messages at once. You can scale your
                            support team using a Chatbot to resolve unlimited requests.</p>

                        <p>Chatbot is multi-purpose. It describes the "established" knowledge and talent behind a
                            Chatbot. At first, the university can only aim to assist new students in the application
                            process and the new participation process, but as time goes on, the university can develop
                            new skills without the need for another Chatbot. This means that the same chat bot guiding
                            applicants and new students can also be used to inform exams, scholarships, e-learning
                            services and more.</p>



                        <p>It always works. Unlike online live support, bots are not tied to things like working hours.
                            A Chatbot runs 24/7. So if perspective or new students need to chat at 3am or weekend,
                            Chatbot will gladly answer all your questions and messages. Chatbot will also work even if
                            the entire campus is on vacation. Chatbot can handle high traffic. The most common problem
                            when using live chat support (with a real human representative) is that applicants or new
                            students should wait until they get someone to help them. This is mostly due to a limited
                            number of human agents compared to the number of incoming messages. This worsens during busy
                            times when the number of incoming chats is very high. It is important that the university
                            make sure that they have placed Chatbot on a skilled infrastructure.</p>
